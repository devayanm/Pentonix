Explanation for the  Question 1:-


1. Firstly I started by defining a function named length_of_longest_substring that takes a string `s` as input.
2. Inside the function, i declared some variables like char_index_map, max_length, start.
3. Then I run a loop through all the characters inide the input string s.
4. For each character the loop check if it's already in the char_index_map. 
5. Then checks if its index is greater than or equal to the current index that means the start index.
6. If both conditions are true, it means this character is the repeating character in the substring.
7. After this the index at start is updated to the next index to exclude the repeating character from the current substring.
8. Then the char_index_map is updated with the current character's index.
9. The length of the current substring is calculated using end - start + 1.
10. Then the max_length and current max_length is updated with the calculated length.
11. Once the loop has runned through all the characters, we return the max_length, which is the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
12. And at the last I have taken input from the user and then print the desired output.
